# JARVIS-Pi

### If you are reading, it means I invited you to see my project, the JARVIS Pi.
### This account was specifically created to allow the people I choose to see the code and description of this project. I have chosen this approach because I feel that I must show this project to possible job recruiters or teachers, and therefore I ask you not to modify any of the code in this repository, and also not to share this information with anyone since it is a private project.

### So what is the JARVIS Pi?

### My goal is to create a virtual personal assistant which will be placed somewhere inside a house or office (in one or more rooms). The singularity of this system is that it will not require a keyboard, mouse or screen, since you will be able to interact with it using only your voice.
### Some of the features I would like to include would be:

* Scheduling alarms and timers
* Using a chronometer (start, stop and lap)
* Weather forecast
* Playing music
* Opening or closing electrical blinds on windows
* Toggling lights

### I'm programming the software using Java on Eclipse for several reasons: I feel comfortable coding in Java quickly and correctly; the use of Design Patterns is made more simple by Java itself and the Eclipse features; Java simplifies interaction with microphones and speakers.
### I have also considered using C++, mainly because it is more efficient than Java in many aspects, but since I don't expect the final result to be a very "heavy" program, I think Java will do just fine.

### Also, I intend to run the software on a Raspberry Pi, since it is a small and powerfull device with many features, such as internet acces, which is perfect if I go on to building a mobile app to interact with the JARVIS system via WiFi.

### Please remember to keep this information private, and thank you for your cooperation. This is a very important project for me, so you must be somehow important to me since I gave you access to my biggest hobbie of all! Thank you!
